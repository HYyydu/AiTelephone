# 🛍️ AI as Customer - Usage Examples

## 📋 Overview

Your AI agent now acts as a **CUSTOMER** calling customer service, not as customer service itself. The AI will call real human customer service representatives with specific requests, complaints, or questions.

## 🎭 How It Works

**Role Reversal:**
- ✅ **AI = Customer** (has a problem/request)
- ✅ **Human = Customer Service Rep** (answers and helps)

**Call Flow:**
1. AI calls the customer service number
2. Human answers: "Hello, how can I help you today?"
3. AI explains their situation: "Hi, I need to return a product..."
4. Human asks questions, AI responds naturally
5. Conversation continues until resolution

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Be Specific in Purpose**
- ❌ Bad: "Call about a problem"
- ✅ Good: "I bought shoes online but received the wrong size. I need to exchange size 8 for size 9."

### 2. **Provide Realistic Context**
- Include order numbers, dates, account details
- Makes the AI's responses more believable
- Example: "Order #12345 placed on March 1st"

### 3. **Set Clear Expectations**
- What outcome does the customer want?
- How should they react to different responses?
- Example: "If they offer refund, accept. If only store credit, negotiate."

### 4. **Match Tone to Situation**
- Complaint → Firm but polite
- Inquiry → Friendly and curious  
- Urgent issue → Concerned but professional

### 5. **Test Edge Cases**
- AI stays calm when CS rep is unhelpful
- AI provides additional details when asked
